Like other compulsive gamblers, lottery addicts soon begin spending from their savings and loans, they start to accumulate debts, and eventually engage in desperate behaviors like theft.\n",

    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
