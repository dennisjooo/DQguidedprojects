# Dataquest Guided Projects

So during my semester break in 2021, I decided to spend my free time learning how to code again. Previously, I have had some coding courses in my university so I thought why not learn more. Joining Dataquest was probably the best decision I have made in a long time. Unlike other coding sites, Dataquest does not use video tutorials, instead you are actually doing the actual coding. It suits my style a lot because before I found Dataquest, I have enrolled into some video-based courses which were quite boring and confusing because you are essentialy watching someone doing the work for you. Dataquest also teached me to read documentaries, which I used to find very redundant since you can Google things that you want to do, but I find using documentaries much faster and detailed.
In Dataquest, there are some challenging Guided Projects which helps you to learn based on available datasets. Some of the projects are harder than the other, but overall it did the job of teaching you how to clean, analyse, and visualize a certain data. I am happy to share some of my works with you. I have to admit, I could not do it without the help of the supportive community they have over there.
Enough jibber-jabber, please enjoy exploring my works :)
